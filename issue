greeting 
1- i will start by writing the general configurations(system, version, smart contract overall idea).
2- then i will show the main problem(with small code line, that i think it need edit).
3- third part i will show what i try until now and the results
4- at the end of i will add the full code.

a- general configurations(system, version, smart contract overall idea):

   a1- operation system: opensuse leap 15.3
   a2- hardhat version: 2.8.3
   a3- node version: v14.18.3
   a4- npm version: 8.3.0
   a5- target chain: polygon (main net, test net)
   
   a5- smart contract overall idea:
       use svg to create erc-721 nft, where it's metadata totally stored on chain(the smart contract mint tokenurl to polygon chain).
       
b- the main problem:
   every thing work good as the size of minted file (tokenurl) less than 23.8kb(small than 23.8 kb). where i target mint file that twice this size (every tokenurl equal 50kb).
   so when try mint tokenurl with size (23.8 Kb < size < 50 Kb) i recive next error message.
   
   An unexpected error occurred:
   Error: ERROR processing /home/naive/demos/secondtry/deploy/01_Deploy_SVGNFT.js:
   Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit (error={"name":"ProviderError","code":-
   32000,"_isProviderError":true}, method="estimateGas", transaction={"from":"metamask wallet address","to":"contract address",
   
c- what i try until now and the results:
   1- try set the gas limit in "hardhat.config" but did not make any effect(it was during search so i do not remmber the form or values).
   
   2- in "01_Deploy_SVGNFT" add gaslimit to tx, so the code line look like next.
      2-0 origonal code line before edit it:  tx = await svgNFT.create(svg)
      2-1 code line after edit it:  tx = await svgNFT.create(svg, {gasLimit: 3000000 })
      2-2 the result: give me some error message about wrong syntic (form, typing)
   
   3- in "01_Deploy_SVGNFT" add gaslimit to tx, so the code line look like next.
      3-0 origonal code line before edit it:  tx = await svgNFT.create(svg)
      3-1 code line after edit it:  tx = await svgNFT.create({svg}, {gasLimit: 3000000 })
      3-2 the results:
         3-2-0 contract deploying, svg uploading, contract verifying, the matic value decrease in metamask wallet(gas value transfer succeed) all thing look good.
         3-2-1 when go to opensea there's no image appears.
         3-2-2 when go to polygonscan or etherscan and use token id to see the token uri it return nothing (ther's no metadata string appears, nothing appears).
         
d- the next github link for full code(contracts, deploy, hardhat.config.js, helper-hardhat-config.js and img folder that contunue (preproduced tokenurl)
   https://github.com/naive2022/onchainfork

hope help me find how can mint preproduced tokenurl(every file size is 50kb) without face this problem when use polygon test or polygon main network.
thanks in advanced
