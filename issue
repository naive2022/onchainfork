greeting 
1- i will start by writing the general configurations(system, version, smart contract overall idea).
2- then i will show the main problem(with small code line, that i think it need edit).
3- third part i will show what i try until now and the results
4- at the end of i will add the full code.

a- general configurations(system, version, smart contract overall idea):

   a1- operation system: opensuse leap 15.3
   a2- hardhat version: 2.8.3
   a3- node version: v14.18.3
   a4- npm version: 8.3.0
   a5- target chain: polygon (main net, test net)
   
   a5- smart contract overall idea:
       use svg to create erc-721 nft, where it's metadata totally stored on chain(the smart contract mint tokenurl to polygon chain).
       
b- the main problem:
   every thing work good as the size of minted file (tokenurl) less than 23.8kb(small than 23.8 kb). where i target twice this size (every tokenurl equal 50kb).
   so when try mint tokenurl with size (23.8 Kb < size < 50 Kb) i recive next error message.
   
   An unexpected error occurred:
   Error: ERROR processing /home/naive/demos/secondtry/deploy/01_Deploy_SVGNFT.js:
   Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit (error={"name":"ProviderError","code":-
   32000,"_isProviderError":true}, method="estimateGas", transaction={"from":"metamask wallet address","to":"contract address",
   
c- what i try until now and the results:
